SlimLightEngine Built with C++. Rendering + 3D Engine. Uses backward ray tracing. Communicate to UI/Output stream through socket. WIP.

## Disclaimers 

This project is not finished yet. It is a work in progress and needs a lot more work in order to be something functionnal.


## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bastien8060/SLE
$ cd SLE
$ cd builds
$ # run the build you want to run in this folder. The binaries are located here.
```

## Build

### Linux & Gnu/Linux

If you are running under Linux or GNU/Linux on an architecture or system that doesn't support the builds, then you can compile yourself the code with a single command. This may not apply to MacOS.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bastien8060/SLE
$ cd SLE
$ ./build.sh
$ cd builds
$ # run the build you want to run in this folder. The binaries you just built are located here.
```

### Other OS
If you are running under another OS, then you can compile the code yourself with a C++ compiler. The file to compile is `main.cpp`.
In case you are running under any issues, feel free to post a new issue in the issues tab of this repository. We might be able to cross compile the code for your system or find a solution.
